.Synopsis
   By GÂ² Development
   PowerShell is able to generate a basic User Interface for the most Commandlets.
.DESCRIPTION
   It doesn't matter if you write your own function or use a provided one from a module.
   The Command "Show-Command" is using a part of the .NET-Framework to automatic build a User Interface based on
   Parameter settings provided by a Commandlet. There are a lot of basic Features which are used in this Function to show up what is possible.
   
   This feature can be used in Windows and by using PowerShell Core on Linux or macOS as well.
   PowerShell Core on Windows https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.2
   PowerShell on Linux https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.2
   PowerShell on MacOs https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-macos?view=powershell-7.2

   Most functionality of the User Interface Window is configured in the parameter itself.
